Neural Inverse Design of Nanostructures (NIDN)
----------------------------------------------

Neural Inverse Design of Nanostructures (NIDN) is a Python project by the Advanced Concepts Team of ESA.
The goal of the project is to enable inverse design of nanostructures, metamaterials, 
photonic crystals, etc., using neural networks in PyTorch. 

Installation
------------

``git clone`` the repository and make sure you have all the requirements installed.

To set up a conda environment for the project run

``conda env create -f environment.yml``.

This will create a conda environment called ``nidn`` for it.

If you just want to install the module in your current environment you can run 

``pip install .`` in the root folder where the setup.py is located.
